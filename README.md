# boardgames-social-network
This is a prof of concept project that was abbandoned. The idea is making a social network for boardgames

Inside archive you can find the sql schema for the db.

By now you had to add some games from the db in order to make it work properly.

Ask me if you wanna be a collaborator, I will not probably continue this project.
